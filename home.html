    <h1>My Hobbies: Cooking and Travelling</h1>

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>
        I really enjoy cooking in my free time. I like trying out new recipes,
        especially simple dishes that I can make quickly on a busy day.
        Cooking helps me relax and be creative with different ingredients.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I often cook pasta, rice dishes and simple curries.</li>
        <li>I like experimenting with spices and sauces.</li>
        <li>Sometimes I cook for my family and friends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Travelling</h2>
    <p>
        Travelling is another hobby I love. I enjoy visiting new places,
        learning about different cultures and trying local food.
        Even short trips give me a lot of new energy and inspiration.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I like visiting cities, nature parks and beaches.</li>
        <li>I enjoy taking photos while travelling.</li>
        <li>In the future I want to visit more countries in Europe.</li>
    </ul>
